          Irving Penn was one of the twentieth century's great photographers,
          known for his arresting images and masterful printmaking. Although he
          was celebrated as one of Vogue magazine's top photographers for more
          than sixty years, Penn was an intensely private man who avoided the
          limelight and pursued his work with quiet and relentless dedication.
          At a time when photography was primarily understood as a means of
          communication, he approached it with an artist's eye and expanded the
          creative potential of the medium, both in his professional and
          personal work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born in 1917 in Plainfield, New Jersey to immigrant parents, Penn
          attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Arts from
          1934–38 and studied with Alexey Brodovitch in his Design Laboratory. A
          formidable Russian émigré who worked in Paris in the 1920s, Brodovitch
          taught the application of principles of modern art and design through
          exposure to magazines, exhibitions, architecture, and photography.

              Irving Penn’s photographic work can be divided between gelatin
              silver prints, platinum-palladium prints, and color prints of
              various types. Some images exist in all three, as is the case with
              Still Life with Food.

              Irving Penn’s photographic work can be divided between gelatin
              silver prints, platinum-palladium prints, and color prints of
              various types. Some images exist in all three, as is the case with
              Still Life with Food, a color image from 1947 which is titled New
              York Still Life in black and white.
            </p>
            <p>
              The photograph originally appeared in Vogue to illustrate the
              imported delicacies available in select New York shops. Presented
              as ingredients for a party, Penn arranged the composition in the
              manner of a Dutch still life. A gelatin silver print was used for
              reproduction in the magazine for the July 1, 1947 issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              The color variant shown here is a silver dye bleach print, a
              positive-to-positive process known for its vivid color, sharpness,
              clarity, and resistance to fading. Amidst the photograph’s
              delicate balance of color, rich hues and warm light, the
              unexpected element of the black beetle on the sack of corn appears
              all the more striking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beginning in the 1960s, Penn conducted extensive experiments to
              revive the nineteenth-century platinum print process. His practice
              involved meticulously coating fine arts papers by hand with
              light-sensitive solutions of platinum and palladium metals. For
              this, he revisited many of his earlier negatives, enlarging them
              to make contact prints up to 22 x 28 inches. The
              platinum-palladium edition of New York Still Life renders the
              warmth and detail present in the silver and color editions.

            <p>
              As a young man, after graduating from the Philadelphia Museum
              School of Industrial Art in 1938, Irving Penn harbored dreams of
              becoming a painter. In 1941–42, he spent a year in Mexico
              painting, but he found his results to be disappointing and
              destroyed all but a small group of drawings. Despite this
              repudiation, drawing continued to play an important role for Penn
              in his subsequent work as a photographer as he worked out an image
              and its composition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following his retrospective exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art
              in 1984, Penn returned to painting after more than forty years. He
              developed unique working methods, inspired by his experiences
              printing photographs in platinum and palladium metals.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 2000, when Penn ceased platinum-palladium printing, he began
              making inkjet prints from digitally scanned drawings. He also
              produced freehand paintings using no photographic or printing
              processes.
